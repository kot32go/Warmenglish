									
An old lady in a plane had a blanketï¼æ¯¯å­ï¼over her head and she did not want to take it off . The air hostess spoke to her, but the old lady said, âI have never been in a plane before , and I am frightened. I am going to keep this blanket over my head until we are back on the ground again !â

Then the captain came. He said, âMadam, I am the captain of this plane. The weather is fine, there are no clouds in the sky, and everything is going very well. âBut she continued to hide.

So the captain turned and started to go back. Then the old lady looked out from under the blanket with one eye and said, âI am sorry, young man, but I donât like planes and I am never going to fly again. But Iâll say one thing, âShe continued kindly, âYou and your wife keep your plane very clean!â
